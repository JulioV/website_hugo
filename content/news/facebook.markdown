Along with ~80 people from all over the UK I was invited to the Facebook hackathon at their HQ in London. In a team of four and in 24 hours, we developed an Android application prototype which aims to teach kids in developing countries how to code using SMS and on-device compiling. You can read more about it on [Raluca's blog](http://ralucageorgescu.co.uk/facebook-hackathon/), check the source code on [Alex's Github](https://github.com/dragosthealex/hackerLite) and try the app [here](https://selene.hud.ac.uk/u1252286/hackerLite/www/#/tab/tutorial).
