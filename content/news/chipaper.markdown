description: "I'm happy to write that our paper <a href='https://juliovega.info/publications#chi2018'>'Back to Analogue: Self-reporting for Parkinson's Disease'</a> has been accepted in CHI 2018. We prototyped five different tech-based artefacts to allow people with Parkinson's report their symptoms. In the end, we chose a paper diary that can be encoded automatically and reached an overall response compliance of 98.5%. Based on a thematic analysis of interviews with our participants, we published five design implications that support the creation of future artefacts to collect self-reported data in Parkinsonâ€™s Disease if researchers decide to go back to analogue or to use a digital medium."
