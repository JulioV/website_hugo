The 3MT competition is all about presenting your research in under three minutes with nothing more than a single slide and your voice. After a preliminary round with other 37 students, two coaching sessions with [Dr Sam Illingworth](https://twitter.com/samillingworth) and [Caroline Clegg](https://twitter.com/FeelgoodTheatre), and a flashing final, I got the **Audience Vote Award**. You can read more about it from [Kirsty McIntyre](https://manchestersteps.wordpress.com/2016/06/15/the-three-minute-thesis-challenge/), the overall winner.
