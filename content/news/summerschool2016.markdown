I was invited to the 2016's [Microsoft PhD Summer School](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/event/phd-summer-school-2016/) in Cambridge, UK. There, I had the chance to present a poster and discuss my work with other PhD students and researchers. I also attended helpful talks on how to write research papers, deliver presentations and create posters; experiencing at first hand the cool research going on there.
