It was an amazing experience to be invited to talk about my PhD at the 2018 edition of [Pint of Science](https://pintofscience.co.uk/about/). PoS is an international festival where researchers go out to the pub to talk about science. The response from the audience was rather positive, and I enjoyed it throughout. My slides are [here](/downloads/pos2018.pdf).
