The Academy of Finland ICT 2023 programme has founded the [Sentient Tracking Of Parkinson’s (STOP)](http://ubicomp.oulu.fi/stop-sentient-tracking-of-parkinsons-funded-by-the-academy-of-finland-ict-2023-programme/) for two years. The project aims to create an infrastructure that links medication alerts to movement phenomena in real-time, to improve medication dosing for Parkinson’s patients and to unobtrusively monitor the progression of Parkinson’s Disease. This is a collaboration among the University of Oulu Medical Faculty (Dr. Jani Katisko), Carnegie Mellon University (Prof. Anind Dey, Julian Ramos), The University of Manchester (Prof. Simon Harper and my self) and is lead by Adj. Prof. Denzil Ferreira from the Center for Ubiquitous Computing at the University of Oulu.
