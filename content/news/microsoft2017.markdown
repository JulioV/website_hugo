For 16 weeks, I worked on [Project Emma](https://blogs.microsoft.com/transform/feature/emma-can-write-again-thanks-to-prototype-watch-raising-hope-for-parkinsons-disease/) mentored by [Haiyan Zhang](https://twitter.com/haiyan) from the [Human Experience & Design group](https://hxd.research.microsoft.com/work/). I co-designed and implemented the first set of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the Emma Watch, including the creation of software and hardware solutions.
