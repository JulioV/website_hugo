I published PaperStream, a desktop app that allows researchers to create paper diaries or surveys that people can answer using a pen, and then, extract all the answers from the scanned pages into a CSV file. I based this app in work by [Luke Plant](https://bitbucket.org/spookylukey/booklet-maker/src) and [Raphael Baron](https://github.com/rbaron/omr). It is implemented in Python and uses OpenCV and Optical Marking Recognition techniques to detect the answers on paper. PaperStream is compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux. You can go to [Paperstream's website](https://paperstream.netlify.com/), check out the [source code](https://github.com/JulioV/paperstream) or install it [using pip](https://paperstream.netlify.com/developer/).
