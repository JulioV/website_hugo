description: "I have published PaperStream, a web app that allows researchers to create paper diaries or surveys that people can answer using a pen, and then, extract all the answers from the scanned pages into a CSV file. I based this app in work done by <a target='_blank' href='https://bitbucket.org/spookylukey/booklet-maker/src'>Luke Plant</a> and <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/rbaron/omr'>Raphael Baron</a>. It is implemented in Python and uses OpenCV and Optical Marking Recognition techniques to detect the answers on paper. PaperStream is compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux. You can go to <a target='_blank' href='https://paperstream.netlify.com/'>Paperstream's website</a>, check out the <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/JulioV/paperstream'>source code</a> or install it <a target='_blank' href='https://paperstream.netlify.com/developer/'>using pip</a>."
