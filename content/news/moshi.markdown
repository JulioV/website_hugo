I have joined the Mobile Sensing + Health Institute ([MoSHI](https://www.moshi.pitt.edu/)) at the Department of Medicine of the University of Pittsburgh mentored by Carissa Low. We will be working on mobile sensing projects to monitor, support and intervene on the life of people with and recovering from cancer.
