I investigate **personalised** methodologies to monitor **chronic conditions** that affect **daily human behaviour** using mobile and wearable data. In the long term, my goal is to explore how we can enable patients to inform, amend, and evaluate their health tracking algorithms to improve disease self-management.

**University of Pittsburgh**. I am working on multiple observational and interventional studies to support people during and after cancer treatment (among other groups). I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate and also the Director of Technology at the [Mobile Sensing + Health Institute](https://www.moshi.pitt.edu/) mentored by [Carissa Low](https://twitter.com/carissa_low).

**RAPIDS**. I am the designer and lead developer of the Reproducible Analysis Pipeline for Data Streams ([RAPIDS](http://www.rapids.science/)), an open source pipeline to standardize the data processing, analysis, and evaluation of mobile sensing projects.

**ex University of Bristol**. We aimed to detect self-harm and binge eating episodes using smartphone interactions. I was a Research Associate working with [Roisin McNaney](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/people/roisin-mcnaney/index.html).

**ex University of Oulu**. We developed and evaluated the [STOP](http://ubicomp.oulu.fi/stop-sentient-tracking-of-parkinsons-funded-by-the-academy-of-finland-ict-2023-programme/) mobile app for tracking Parkinson's hand motor symptoms and medication intake. I am a visiting researcher at the [Ubicomp Lab](http://ubicomp.oulu.fi/) collaborating with [Denzil Ferreira](https://www.oulu.fi/university/researcher/denzil-ferreira)'s team.

**ex University of Manchester**. We explored a personalised, unobtrusive and clinical-informed methodology to track self-reported fluctuations in pain, gait, and fatigue in Parkinson's. I received a PhD in Computer Science during my stay at the [Interaction Analysis and Modelling Lab](http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/our-research/laboratories/iam/) supervised by [Simon Harper](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/simon.harper/), [Caroline Jay](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/caroline.jay/) and [Markel Vigo](http://www.markelvigo.info/).

**ex Microsoft Research Intern**. I worked on [Project Emma](https://blogs.microsoft.com/transform/feature/emma-can-write-again-thanks-to-prototype-watch-raising-hope-for-parkinsons-disease/) co-designing and implementing the first set of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the Emma Watch. I was mentored by [Haiyan Zhang](https://twitter.com/haiyan) from the [HXD group](https://hxd.research.microsoft.com/work/).
