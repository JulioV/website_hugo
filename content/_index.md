I investigate **personalised** methodologies to monitor **chronic conditions** that affect **daily human behaviour** using mobile and wearable data. In the long term, my goal is to explore how we can enable patients to inform, amend, and evaluate their health tracking algorithms to improve disease self-management.

**University of Bristol**. We are working on self-harm and binge eating episode detection using smartphone interactions. I am a Research Associate at the [Digital Health](http://www.bris.ac.uk/engineering/research/digital-health/?_ga=2.21049336.2107843035.1557739749-1608399595.1557739749) group of the Department of Computer Science working with [Roisin McNaney](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/people/roisin-mcnaney/index.html).

**University of Oulu**. We are studying how to improve Parkinson's medication adherence using a mobile game as part of the [STOP](http://ubicomp.oulu.fi/stop-sentient-tracking-of-parkinsons-funded-by-the-academy-of-finland-ict-2023-programme/) project. I am a visiting researcher at the [Ubicomp Lab](http://ubicomp.oulu.fi/) of the University of Oulu, Finland working closely with [Denzil Ferreira](https://www.oulu.fi/university/researcher/denzil-ferreira)'s team.

**ex University of Manchester**. We explored a personalised, unobtrusive and clinical-informed methodology to track self-reported fluctuations in pain, gait, and fatigue in Parkinson's. I received a PhD in Computer Science during my stay at the [Interaction Analysis and Modelling Lab](http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/our-research/laboratories/iam/) supervised by [Simon Harper](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/simon.harper/), [Caroline Jay](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/caroline.jay/) and [Markel Vigo](http://www.markelvigo.info/).

**ex Microsoft Research Intern**. I worked on [Project Emma](https://blogs.microsoft.com/transform/feature/emma-can-write-again-thanks-to-prototype-watch-raising-hope-for-parkinsons-disease/) co-designing and implementing the first set of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the Emma Watch. I was mentored by [Haiyan Zhang](https://twitter.com/haiyan) from the [HXD group](https://hxd.research.microsoft.com/work/).
