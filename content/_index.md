I am currently working on a new methodology to monitor Parkinson's Disease. Traditional and tech-supported monitoring can be uncomfortable or invasive for people with Parkinson's. I am exploring if we can use smartphones and the web to collect and combine multiple data sources to infer human habits that work as a proxy to the symptoms' severity. I expect that this personalised, longitudinal and unobtrusive approach will support patients, carers and clinicians.

I am a fourth year PhD Candidate and a member of the Interaction Analysis and Modelling Lab in the Computer Science School of the University of Manchester. My supervisors are Simon Harper, Caroline Jay and Markel Vigo. I am also a research collaborator and visitor at the Ubicomp Lab of the University of Oulu, Finland, working on the STOP project exploring the use of smartphones and motion sensors to unobtrusively measure Parkinsonâ€™s medication cycles.
