 I am currently working on a <b>new methodology to monitor Parkinson's Disease</b>. Traditional and tech-supported monitoring can be uncomfortable
or invasive for people with Parkinson's. I am exploring if we can use smartphones and the web to collect and
<b>combine</b> multiple data sources to infer
<b>human habits</b> that work as a proxy to the symptoms' severity. I expect that this
<b>personalised, longitudinal and unobtrusive </b> approach will support patients, carers and clinicians.</p>
<p>I am a fourth year PhD Candidate and a member of the

<a href="http://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/">Computer Science School</a> of the
<a href="http://www.manchester.ac.uk/">University of Manchester</a>. My supervisors are
<a href="http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/simon.harper/">Simon Harper</a>,
<a href="http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/caroline.jay/">Caroline Jay</a> and
<a href="http://www.markelvigo.info/">Markel Vigo</a>. I am also a research collaborator and visitor at the <a href="http://ubicomp.oulu.fi/">Ubicomp Lab</a> of the <a href="http://www.oulu.fi/university/">University of Oulu</a>, 
Finland, working on the <a href="http://ubicomp.oulu.fi/stop-sentient-tracking-of-parkinsons-funded-by-the-academy-of-finland-ict-2023-programme/">STOP project</a> exploring the use of 
smartphones and motion sensors to unobtrusively measure Parkinsonâ€™s medication cycles.
