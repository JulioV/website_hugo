The WWW and W4A conferences, Google Montreal and the [Partnership on Employment & Accessible Technology (PEAT)](http://www.peatworks.org/) put together a hackathon to work on the accessibility features of the [H5P interactive objects](https://h5p.org/). In a team of six and in 4 hours, we improved the keyboard accessibility capabilities and added text alternatives and chart summaries to the [H5P's Chart](https://h5p.org/node/6729) plugin. You can check our source code [here](https://github.com/JulioV/h5p-chart) and read more about the event [here](http://peatworks.org/blog/2016/may/w4awww-hackathon-recap-right-people-room-makes-big-difference).
