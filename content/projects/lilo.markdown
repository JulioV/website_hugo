description: "In a team of four and in 24 hours, we developed this Android application prototype which aims to teach kids in developing countries how to code using SMS and on-device compiling. I contributed with the transpiler from our in-house reduced syntax (Lilo) to JavaScript and with online code execution through a Facebook page. You can read more about it on <a target='_blank' href='http://ralucageorgescu.co.uk/facebook-hackathon/'>Raluca's blog</a>, check the source code on <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/dragosthealex/hackerLite'>Alex's Github</a> and try the app <a target='_blank' href='https://selene.hud.ac.uk/u1252286/hackerLite/www/#/tab/tutorial'>here</a>."
