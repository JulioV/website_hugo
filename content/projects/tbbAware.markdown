[TinyBlackBox](https://github.com/AndreFPRodrigues/TBB) is an Android app that captures interaction data. It was developed by [researchers](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2811379&dl=ACM&coll=DL&CFID=843847077&CFTOKEN=52456863) from the University of Dundee and Lisbon. I modified the original app to work with the [Aware Framework](http://www.awareframework.com/) to allow for encryption and web syncronisation.
