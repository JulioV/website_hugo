A web app that allows researchers to create paper diaries or surveys that people can answer using a pen, and then, extract all the answers from the scanned pages into a CSV file. I based this app in the work done by [Luke Plant](https://bitbucket.org/spookylukey/booklet-maker/src) and [Raphael Baron](https://github.com/rbaron/omr). It is implemented in Python and uses OpenCV and Optical Marking Recognition techniques to detect the answers on paper. PaperStream is compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux. You can go to [Paperstream's website](https://paperstream.netlify.com/), check out the [source code](https://github.com/JulioV/paperstream) or install it [using pip](https://paperstream.netlify.com/developer/). You can also read more about its development at the [Software Sustainability Institute' blog](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2018-08-02-paperstream-software-collects-data-multiple-answer-questions-documents) and a repost I did in [dev.to](https://dev.to/julio_ui/paperstream-collecting-data-from-multiple-answer-question-documents-50c5).
