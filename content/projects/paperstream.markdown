description: "A web app that allows researchers to create paper diaries or surveys that people can answer using a pen, and then, extract all the answers from the scanned pages into a CSV file. I based this app in the work done by <a target='_blank' href='https://bitbucket.org/spookylukey/booklet-maker/src'>Luke Plant</a> and <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/rbaron/omr'>Raphael Baron</a>. It is implemented in Python and uses OpenCV and Optical Marking Recognition techniques to detect the answers on paper. PaperStream is compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux. You can go to <a target='_blank' href='https://paperstream.netlify.com/'>Paperstream's website</a>, check out the <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/JulioV/paperstream'>source code</a> or install it <a target='_blank' href='https://paperstream.netlify.com/developer/'>using pip</a>. You can also read more about its development at the <a href='https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2018-08-02-paperstream-software-collects-data-multiple-answer-questions-documents'>Software Sustainability Institute' blog</a> and a repost I did in <a href='https://dev.to/julio_ui/paperstream-collecting-data-from-multiple-answer-question-documents-50c5'>dev.to</a>."
