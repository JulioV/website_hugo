description: "As the final project of my masters degree I modelled the walking dynamics of a group of pedestrians at a personal scale based on cellular automata and multiagent systems. The simulated scenarios are up to 91% accurate (70% on average) compared to real data. I used JavaScript (LeafletJS.com) and Java. My supervisors were <a target='_blank' href='https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Szh5H38AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao'>Miguel Torres-Ruiz</a> and <a target='_blank' href='https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=YIVxg1AAAAAJ&hl=en'>Marco Moreno-Ibarra</a>. You can watch a simulated scenario <a target='_blank' href=' https://goo.gl/UkR2Wb'>here</a>."
