During a research visit to the [LIRIS Lab](https://liris.cnrs.fr/) and under the supervision of [Sylvie Servigne](https://liris.cnrs.fr/membres?idn=sservign), I developed a prototype of a Voluntary Geographical Information Web application to be deployed in emergency situations so citizens can create security, health and other types of reports from desktop and mobile devices. I used GIS tools (GeoServer, LeafletJS.com), Java and PostgreSQL. You can watch a demo [here](https://goo.gl/3Hx641).
