description: "During a research visit to the <a target='_blank' href='https://liris.cnrs.fr/'>LIRIS Lab</a> and under the supervision of <a target='_blank' href='https://liris.cnrs.fr/membres?idn=sservign'>Sylvie Servigne</a>, I developed a prototype of a Voluntary Geographical Information Web application to be deployed in emergency situations so citizens
can create security, health and other types of reports from desktop and mobile devices. I used GIS tools
(GeoServer, LeafletJS.com), Java and PostgreSQL. You can watch a demo <a target='_blank' href='https://goo.gl/3Hx641'>here</a>."
