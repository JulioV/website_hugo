description: "In a team of four and in 24 hours, we developed this prototype to visualise car-produced CO<sub>2</sub> emissions filtered by UK post code, car's manufacturer and year. The backend runs on NodeJS and the front end uses the LeafletJS library. We combined geographical information data, <a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOT_test'>MOT tests</a> data and <a target='_blank' href='https://www.gov.uk/co2-and-vehicle-tax-tools'>UK Gov CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</a> data. You can check the source code <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/JulioV/co2much'>here</a>."
