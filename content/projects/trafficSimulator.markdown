For my Bachelor's final project and in a team of two, we developed a web traffic simulator. I worked in the front-end using the Geolayers library and in the geographic backend using Geoserver and PostgreSQL. The simulator core was based on multi-agent systems and Petri networks; you can think of it as water (cars) filling out pipes (streets). Simulated data was up to 81% accurate (72% on average) compared to real traffic data. It was possible to simulate the entire Mexico City's traffic network. You can watch a simulation running [here](https://goo.gl/B8dSbV). **This project won the runner up at Mexico City's Engineering Prize 2011.**
