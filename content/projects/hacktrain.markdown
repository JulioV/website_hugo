description: "In a team of five and in 24 hours, we developed this prototype to identify the train's overhead lines from a 3D cloud of points. We used the <a target='_blank' href='http://pointclouds.org/'>PCL</a> library to clean and filter the data representing 5 French train stations. This project won the 2<sup>nd</sup> price at the <a target='_blank' href='http://hacktrain.com/uk/index.html'>HackTrain 3.0</a> competition."
