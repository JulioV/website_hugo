In a team of five and in 24 hours, we developed this prototype to identify the train's overhead lines from a 3D point cloud. We used the [PCL](http://pointclouds.org/) library to clean and filter the data representing 5 French train stations. This project won the 2nd price at the [HackTrain 3.0](http://hacktrain.com/uk/index.html) competition.
