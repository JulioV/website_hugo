I am the designer and lead developer of the Reproducible Analysis Pipeline for Data Streams ([RAPIDS](https://www.rapids.science/latest/)). It enables a consistent, efficient and parallel analysis of smartphone and wearable data to extract behavioral features (a.k.a. digital biomarkers/phenotypes). Among other functionality, it provides extensible, tested and reproducible code, timezone management, flexible day segments, and a catalogue of over 100 behavioral features.
