I've published an [R markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) template for the University of Manchester's master and PhD theses based on the Computer Science [latex template](http://studentnet.cs.manchester.ac.uk/resources/latex/MUThesis/) and [thesisdown](https://github.com/rensa/unswthesisdown). It is great for reproducibility, saves you tons of time because your results, figures and tables go directly to your doc, and you don't need to fiddle around with latex tables anymore. Installation instructions are in [this repo](https://github.com/JulioV/uomthesisdown).
