After our demo at [Measuring Behaviour 2018](/publications#mb2018) I was invited to blog about PaperStream's development. You can read about my journey going from a prototype using Python's Tkinter to a Web app using Falcon at the [Software Sustainability Institute' blog](https://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2018-08-02-paperstream-software-collects-data-multiple-answer-questions-documents) and a repost I did in [dev.to](https://dev.to/julio_ui/paperstream-collecting-data-from-multiple-answer-question-documents-50c5).
