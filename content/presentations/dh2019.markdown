I shared all the insights I got from the real world deployment of my PhD project for the [Understanding Data and Decision Making](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/study/masters/courses/list/10076/msc-health-data-science/?pg=2&unit=IIDS67622&unitYear=all) module of the [MSc in Health Data Science](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/study/masters/courses/list/10076/msc-health-data-science/) at the University of Manchester.
