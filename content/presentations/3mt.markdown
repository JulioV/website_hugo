title: "3 Minute Thesis Competition"
subtitle: "Audience Vote Award"
description: "The 3MT competition is all about compressing and communicating your research in under three minutes with nothing more than one slide and your voice. After a preliminary round with other 37 students, two coaching sessions with <a target='_blank' href='https://twitter.com/samillingworth'> Dr Sam Illingworth</a> and <a target='_blank' href='https://twitter.com/FeelgoodTheatre'>Caroline Clegg</a>, and a flashing final, I got the <b>Audience Vote Award</b>. You can read more about it from <a target='_blank' href='https://manchestersteps.wordpress.com/2016/06/15/the-three-minute-thesis-challenge/'>Kirsty McIntyre</a>, the overall winner"
